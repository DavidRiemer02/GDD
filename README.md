# GDD – Generated Dataset Detector

**GDD** is a machine learning-based framework that detects whether a tabular dataset is *real* or *synthetically generated*. It combines statistical analysis with structural dependency profiling (using Metanome) to extract discriminative features and uses a Random Forest classifier, optimized by GridSearch to make predictions.
